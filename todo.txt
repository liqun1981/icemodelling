Where to start
* figure text on whats forcing the model
* transform weather data for arbitrary time series resolution

Larger nice to have task
* plot layer temperatures

Energy balance stuff
* implement second correction routine
* implement momentum term in turbulent fluxes (eq 1 in On the parameterization of turbulent surface fluxes over heterogeneous sea ice surfaces)
* calculate implement shortwave atuenation in the colomn top layers in energy_balance_from_temp_sfc
* make reference list for articles
* test rho_new_snow with different temps and both methods

Will it be done or the code removed?
* comment cloudcover functions
