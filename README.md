Ice-modelling
=============

In order to improve the Ice forecasts on varsom.no, we are developing a one-dimensional thermodynamic model for lake ice thickness simulations. The model uses input from the Norwegian Metrological Surface Network database, publically available through eKlima.no. The model can be run in real-time on the latest observations and can use the 10 day forecasts given from met.no to predict the expected changes.
